**Blog URL:** http://integrationassistance.blog/?p=261

In this blog, we will demonstrate how to use custom business events in mule in order track the business data for audit purpose or any other kind of reporting purpose.

Use the Custom Business Event component (tracking:custom-event element in the XML view) to add metadata and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to your flow. 

The Business Events tab on the management console gives you visibility into business transactions and events on your Mule servers, allowing you to track and analyze the flow and disposition of messages. For example, you can use the data to do root cause analysis on a failure within a business transaction or identify message processing bottlenecks.

Anypoint Platform supports defining the same set of business events whether it is On Premise or iPaaS. These events can be designed, developed and monitored seamlessly across on premise and iPaaS solutions.
