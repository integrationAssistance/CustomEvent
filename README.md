# CustomEvent
The Business Events tab on the management console gives you visibility into business transactions and events on your Mule servers, allowing you to track and analyze the flow and disposition of messages. For example, you can use the data to do root cause analysis on a failure within a business transaction or identify message processing bottlenecks.
